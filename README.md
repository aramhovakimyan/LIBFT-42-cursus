# LIBFT-42-cursus

The **libft** project is a C library that provides a collection of custom-made functions that you can use in future projects at **42 Cursus**. This library includes a wide variety of functions that are commonly used in programming, including functions for manipulating strings, working with memory and singly linked-lists.

## Getting Started
To get started with `libft`, you'll need to clone this repository onto your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/aramhovakimyan/libft.git`

Once you've cloned the repository, you can compile the library by running the following command in your terminal:

`make`

This will generate a static library file called `libft.a`, which you can link to your future projects.

## Usage

To use `libft` functions in your project, you'll need to include the appropriate header file:

`#include "libft.h"`

This will give you access to all of the functions in the `libft` library. You can use these functions just like any other standard library function.

## Contributing

If you find a bug in `libft` or would like to contribute a new function, please feel free to submit a pull request. We welcome contributions from anyone, regardless of their level of experience.
